# Data_analysis_dashboard
This project explores a retail sales dataset using Excel. The core of the work is an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard that tracks profit drivers, customer behavior, and regional performance across time.

**What’s inside**
Full dataset and the dashboard built using **pivot tables**, **slicers**, and **custom visuals**.

**Dashboard Highlights**
The dashboard answers a few simple but important questions:

**1. How are we performing overall?**
Key metrics such as total transactions, quantity sold, total revenue, cost, and overall profit are displayed for a quick status check.

**2. Are we growing?**
A trend chart shows how profit moves month by month across multiple years. Spikes and drops are immediately visible, so it’s easy to investigate what changed.

**3. Which customers are most profitable?**
Breakdowns by **gender** and **age** group help identify customer segments that generate the most value. For example, **adults** contribute more profit than other groups.

**4. Where are we winning geographically?**
Top-performing states are ranked by profit. This makes it clear which regions drive the business and which ones may need attention.

**5. What products make the money?**
A combined Cost vs Product vs Profit view highlights the categories with the strongest returns. **Phones**, for instance, show higher profitability compared to other categories.

**6. Who is selling the best?**
Salesperson filters allow comparison of performance across team members.
